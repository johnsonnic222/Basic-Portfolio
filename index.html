                Welcome to my page!  A little about myself:  If you havn't figured it out my name is Nicole Johnson.  I reign from the 
                frozen tundra called Wisconsin.  I grew up there during my childhood and continued my college education there at the 
                University of Wisconsin-Lacrosse where I majored in International Business, Finance, and Spanish.  My interests led me down
                a bit of a different path into international relations and defense policy.  
                <br><br>
                I've been fortuante and have had the opportunity to 
                travel often for academic and professional purposes. I have lived in Spain and Italy and have traveled far and wide throughout
                Europe, South America, Africa, and the Middle East.  My curiosity and love of learning has now led me to my current adventure
                at GW Coding Bootcamp.  I'm excited to be learning this new skillset and hope to be able to incorporate it in my 
                future endeavors. 
                <br><br>
                A few of my interests/hobbies include a huge love for dogs, reading, snowboarding, camping, trying new foods, 
                traveling, and hiking.
